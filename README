To work with the template:

1. Copy to location of choice
2. Run the 'getstarted' script, which will:
- ask you for the file names (you give it <fname>, NO extensions, please)
- ask you for the document title
- change doc.* to <fname>.*
- add <fname> to the appropriate location in the Makefile
- change the <fname>.tex file to include <fname>.bib as bibliography
- change the title in cern-title.tex
3. Delete the 'getstarted' script
4. Write your documentation
5. Type 'make' to create your .pdf documentation file.

NOTE: You need Inkscape to generate .pdf files for the figures:
sudo apt-get install inkscape
